I chose java for my language. It's been a while since i've used it but it is the language that i used when i was working full time as a junior software developer.  Most of these tools integrate seamlessly to popular java IDE:s such as IntelliJ IDEA. 
 The most popular linter seems to be checkstyle. I have personally used SonarLint. For testing JUnit and Mockito are used often. I have also used them myself. Popular build tools that i have experience with myself are Maven and Gradle. Some alternatives for CI setup besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions are GitLab and Bitbucket pipelines. 
In this hypothetical situation, the best approach would probably be using a cloud-based environment atleast in the start unless there are some serious security considerations or performance needs. Cloud-based environment provides easier setup and maintenance, and the upfront costs are lower. This means that the team doesnt need a dedicated devops engineer for the CI. In this situation the app is also in active development and will be released soon so i dont think it would be a good idea to introduce a complex CI at this point. This would slow down the development process and potential onboarding of new employees.
